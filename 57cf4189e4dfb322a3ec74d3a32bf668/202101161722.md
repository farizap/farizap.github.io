# Separation of Concern (SoC)
#softwareprinciple #SoC

Don't write your program as one block code. Divide it into chunks that has **simple** function and job. The objective is to achieve high cohesion & low coupling [[202101161747]]

* ### SoC for programming function
The lowest level of SoC implementation. Avoid creating long complex function. 

* ### SoC for Modules
Group the function under self-contained module that has spesific task and clear correlation

* ### SoC for system's design
Outline boundaries of modules. The most common implementation is separating module into layers. Such as MVC
