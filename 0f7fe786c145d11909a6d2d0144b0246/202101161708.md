Client Side Architecture in [khalilstemmler article](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/client-side-architecture) used Model View Presenter as the starter, but we need to expand more because MVP & MVC is to generic. And Model in MVP has much responsibility

MVP in the generic model. View create user event that trigger changes to Model

Architectural Concern in frontend:
- Presentational component
- State management
- UI logic
- Infrastructure Layer
- Controller
- Interaction logic
- Application / interaction logic
- Fetch logic

Design principle used:
* SoC [[202101161722]]. So each layer in the architecture only has one specific job
* CQS, Command-Query Separation. The benefit is to simplifies code path, operation is easy to reason about, and co-locating

To understand how SoC and CQS work together, we must think each feature is vertical slice of layer / stack [[202101172257]]

Layers in MVP is illustated in this image 
![MVP](../../assets/img/Client-MVP.png)

it consist:
* Presentation Component [[202101212043]]
* UI Logic [[202101212051]]
* Container / controller [[202101212100]]
* Interaction Layer [[202102281612]]
* Networking & data fetching (Infrastructure) [[202102281629]]
