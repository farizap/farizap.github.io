> Render the UI & create user event

It is implementation detail / low level detail in our apps. Most likely this layer is volatile & frequently change. So make sure not make our high level detail depends on this layer.
Example code: 
```javascript
export const Todo = (props) => (
  <div className="todo">
    <div class="todo-text">{props.text}</div>
    <button onClick={props.onDeleteTodo}>Delete</button>
  </div>
)
```

In this layer we focus on styling the component, display data, & generate user event. There is no logic here & all event passed to parent component.

Because it is volatile. There is no need to unit test this layer
