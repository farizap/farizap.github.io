" If people can't build monolith properly, microservices won't help"

"Model-Code Gap" : The difference between our model (abstraction) with our code (implementation detail)

There are 4 common approach:
* Package by layer: horizontal layering. Only good for example or simple app
* Package by feature: vertical slicing [[202101172257]]. The caveats is when two different package communicate
* Port & Adapter
* Package by component : Organise code by bundling together everything related to a "component"

> Separting interface from implementation
