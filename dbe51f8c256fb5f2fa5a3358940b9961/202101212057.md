# Treatise of State
#frontend

* local (component) : State that belongs to a single component. Can also be thought about as UI state. UI state can be extracted from a presentation component into a React hook.
* shared (global) : As soon as some state belongs to more than one component, it's shared global state. Components shouldn't need to know about each other (a header shouldn't need to know about a todo).
* remote (global) : The state that exists behind APIs in services. When we make queries for remote state, we hold onto a local copy of it accessible from a global scope.
* meta : Meta state refers to state about state. The best example of this is the loading async states that tell us the progress of our network requests.
* router state: The current URL of the browser.
