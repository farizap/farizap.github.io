There are several way to identify notes, the most common are:
- Luhmann-ID
  - Best for paper-based zetterkasten
- Timebased-ID
  - Simple way to make a unique identifier. ex: 202006110955
- arbitrary unique string
- title as identifier
  - Ok as long as the title is unique. The cons is you must change all link reference when the title change
