### Name
> What is?  
> Naming classes, files, folder

*  Approach #1  
    Name Files = Domain (Subdomain) + Construct  
    User(Domain) => Auth, Role, Permission(Subdomain)  
    example:  
      - authController
      - roleController
      - authMapper
      - roleMapper

* Approach #2  
    Folder name by subdomain or (optional) domain + Construct  

    - User(folder):  
      - controller(folder):
        - userController(file)   
      - mapper(folder):
        - userMapper(file)
        - roleMapper(file) 

### Construct
> What it does?  
> Tools (or pattern) that we plug together to build web app

Each construct is responsible to one type of behavior. And each construct should never responsible for more that one subdomain element


### Structure
> Where it belongs?

Naturally we use Package by Infrastructre. But its better to use package by Component to help more understanding the project. Its also mentioned in [[202102281643]]
